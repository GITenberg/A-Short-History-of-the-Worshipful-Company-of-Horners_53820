  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The discovery of the “Old Book of the
Worshipful Company of Horners,” which has
probably been missing for some 250 years, has
brought added interest to the consideration of what
is, perhaps, the oldest of the City Gilds.</p>

<p class='c011'>In studying the documents and compiling the
account of that book, recently distributed to the
members of the Company by the kindness of the
late Master, Mr. Edmonds, I was drawn to take in
hand the lengthy and difficult task of reconstructing
the life history of this interesting Craft Gild. Such
a work is the product only of years of patient labour,
but, in the meantime, at the request of the Court, I
am glad to offer some preliminary details which
may serve at least to show the age and dignity of
the Worshipful Company of Horners.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have endeavoured, where possible, to incorporate
passages from the late Mr. Compton’s paper before
the British Archæological Society, but, owing to
many discoveries having been made which were not
at his disposal, I have had to take a different course
in some respects.</p>

<p class='c011'>I wish, however, to state that this short history
cannot in any sense be considered a complete or even
sufficient account of the Company, but must hide
behind the expressed wish of the Court that, in this
instance, it should be of modest dimensions.</p>

</div>

<hr class='c013' />

<div class='sidenote'>Origin of Gilds.</div>

<p class='c011'>The study of Gilds, their origin and development,
is amongst the most fascinating of all
literary pursuits, but though many whose names rank
high in the world of letters have gone deeply into
the problems which the subject presents, the early
days of gild life, at least, in this country, are still
to some extent shrouded in the mists of speculation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Whether Craft Gilds came to England from the
far-off glories of Greece and Rome, whether they
were the descendants of the early Saxon or Danish
“blood brotherhoods,” or even derived partly from
the one and partly from the other, is still a moot
point.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are practically no records of any importance
of Craft Gilds in this country before the arrival
of the Normans, though during the time of the
Roman occupation there must have been many such
extant. At quite an early period of the Roman
occupation, we know that the Gild of Smiths, “Collegium
Fabrorum,” existed in this country.</p>

<p class='c011'>At a later period it is clear that England was
covered with a network of Frith Gilds, but whether
these were Trade Gilds in the accepted sense or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>not has yet to be shown. It seems probable, however,
that they were Agricultural Gilds enforced
upon the inhabitants by their Saxon conquerors, and
that in the more populous neighbourhoods and towns,
craftsmen and merchants were included under their
own special “tything” or possibly even had their
own “hundred”.</p>

<p class='c011'>Whether this were the case or not, it will be obvious
to all that in Saxon and Norman England alike,
wherever several persons were plying the same trade,
there must have existed some sort of organization
for mutual protection and for the instruction of
others. Throughout the known world from the very
earliest periods, workmen of the different classes have
always formed their own aggregations and have
always associated themselves together for mutual
assistance and protection. The need for something
of this sort must have been very urgent in days when
there was less security to life and property, and in
days when, as we are led to suppose, the Saxon rulers
felt scant sympathy for the towns where trades would
be found to exist most extensively.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Antiquity of Gilds in England.</div>

<p class='c011'>The more we study mediæval life in our own
country, the more impossible it becomes to imagine
any regular trade as existing apart from some
official or semi-official organization, combining one
or more of the following obligations: Control of
the workers, education of novices, civil representation
(generally through some influential patron or head),
and nearly always carrying out the work of a burial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>and insurance society. That such a banding together
of those, whether merchants or craftsmen, interested
in any particular occupation, must have existed
during the Saxon period with the object of promoting
one or more of the objects mentioned, is hardly
open to doubt. It would be specially in the towns,
such as London, in which, as Sir Lawrence Gomme
has pointed out, the Roman ideals of organization
still persisted, even into Norman times, that Gild life
or its analogue would be most definitely marked.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Gild, not Guild.</div>

<p class='c011'>Such Societies, Unions, or Combinations for common
interests, whether of Trade, Religion, or social
needs, were called Gilds, the word being derived from
the Anglo-Saxon <i>Gildan</i> or <i>Gildare</i>, to pay, an allusion
to the contribution demanded from every member
towards the common fund.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Antiquity of the Horner’s Craft.</div>

<p class='c011'>It may be justly claimed that amongst the earliest
trades or crafts of this country was that of the
Horner, who was indispensable to the community,
inasmuch as he was the purveyor of many articles
absolutely necessary for domestic purposes. In the
days, for instance, of Kings Ina and Alfred metals
of any kind were rare and consequently costly.
Articles required for eating and drinking, such as
cups, plates, forks, etc., as well as vessels for the preservation
of liquids and powders, were made from
horn, that being the least expensive and the most
easily attainable material for those who had risen
above the use of wooden articles for similar purposes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Laws of Ina.</div>

<p class='c011'>That trades did exist throughout the Saxon period
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>is clear, nor should it be doubted that among the
more important of those trades was that of the
Horner. Indeed, though little else of a commercial
character is alluded to in the laws of King Ina
(A.D. 688-726), those laws lay down the price at
which horns are to be bought and sold, and thereby
indicate the importance of the horner to the community.
“Bovis cornu decem denariis valeat Vaccæ
cornu duobus denariis valeat.”—No mean price,
surely, at that early period.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Horn Tenure.</div>

<p class='c011'>Not only are horns mentioned in the early Norse
Runic inscriptions (see <i>Deutsches Literatur Zeitung</i>,
April 2nd, 1910), but there have been, from the earliest
days, many well-known instances of beautifully
worked horns used as a method of conveyancing
property. Ulphus’s Horn, a drinking horn now
at York, is, perhaps, the best known example. It
was presented by him to the Church in token of the
conveyance of his lands to the Church Authorities.
King Edgar granted privileges to Glastonbury Abbey
by means of a horn. For a very long period the
family of Pusey held the village of Pusey by virtue
of a horn, given to William Picoli by King Canute.
Edward the Confessor granted the Rangership of
Bernwode Forest, Bucks, to be held by a horn, while
Randal de Meschines, third Earl of Chester, conferred
on Allan Silvestris the Bailywick of the Forest
of Wirall by delivering to him a horn, which was ever
after preserved at Hooton. Ingulphus, Abbot of
Croyland, mentions the horn amongst those things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>whereby land was conveyed in the Conqueror’s reign.
This recalls the lines of Wordsworth in the “Horn
of Egremont Castle.”</p>

      <div class='line'>“By the proof upon the Horn.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Drinking Horns.</div>

<p class='c011'>Both Pliny and Cæsar allude to the elaborate
horn cups of their period. Johannis Salisburiensis
tells us that the Danes used horns as well as the
Saxons, and Giraldus Cambrensis mentions the Horn
of St. Patrick.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sometimes these horns were so skilfully made that
they could be used both for blowing and drinking;
<i>vide</i> Chaucer’s “Frank Tale,” l. 2,809: “And
drinketh of his bugle horn the wine.” Perhaps, however,
the most interesting and historic horn cup was
that which Witlaf, King of Mercia, gave to the Abbey
of Croyland, “cornu mensæ suas ut,” etc.—the horn
from his own table that the elder monks might drink
out of it on Festivals and Saints’ Days, and that
when they gave thanks, they might remember the
soul of Witlaf the donor. Ingulphus mentions that
when the Monastery was almost burnt down this horn
was saved.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Medical Horns.</div>

<p class='c011'>From Payne’s “English Medicine in Anglo-Saxon
Times” we ascertain that during the tenth and
eleventh centuries, at least, the Horners’ trade was
called into use by the apothecary. The author relates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>that in “cupping” operations and the administration
of clysters, horns were used, indicating a nicety of
manufacture which must have placed the trade on a
high level.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Importance in Saxon times.</div>

<p class='c011'>To such a pitch of development had the trade
of a Horner attained at least 250 years before the
Norman Conquest, that even the patens and chalices
used at the Church services were made of this substance,
as may be evidenced from the fact that at the
Council of Chelsea, held A.D. 789, after careful
discussion, it was decided that the chalices and patens
used for ecclesiastical purposes should no longer be
made of horn, but of metal, no doubt to distinguish
them from similar articles which had already come
into general use for common and domestic purposes.</p>

<p class='c011'>At this time glass was probably almost, if not
entirely, unknown in England, and, in consequence,
thin sheets of horn had to be manufactured to serve
many of the purposes to which glass is now applied.</p>

<p class='c011'>These facts, and the general tendency of town life
in this country, make it practically certain that long
before the tenth century the Horner’s trade, in common
with some others, was in full swing, and with
it that which we may deem inseparable from any
considerable trade at that time, something in the
nature of what we now call a Trade or Craft Gild.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Horners’ probably the oldest City Gild.</div>

<p class='c011'>Both tradition and documentary evidence are
agreed that the Horners’ Gild dates back to the far
off ages of antiquity, and we may justly claim that
its foundation is as early as, if not anterior to, any
of the existing City Companies.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Old book of the Worshipful Company of Horners.</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Considerable light has been thrown on the vicissitudes
of the Horners’ Gild by the recent discovery, as
well as recovery, of the most interesting and ancient
MSS. book already alluded to. The existence of this
book, which formerly belonged to the Company, and
was, in fact, its official record, was brought to the
notice of the Clerk of the Company by Dr. Warner,
of the British Museum. After many negotiations
between Mr. Howard Deighton and the then owners
of the volume, it was purchased for the sum of £40.</p>

<p class='c011'>A detailed account of this precious possession has
been given in the form of a publication entitled
“Some Notes on the Old Book of the Worshipful
Company of Horners,” which was distributed to the
members of the Company and their guests at their
last Livery Dinner, by the late Master, Mr. J. T.
Edmonds.</p>

<p class='c011'>Though records relating to Craft Gilds in the
eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries are very
meagre and difficult to discover, the “Old Book of
the Worshipful Company of Horners” has proved
extremely useful in helping to build up a consecutive
history of this extremely early Gild. It demonstrates
the fact that at least as early as the fourteenth
century, both Horners and Bottlemakers were taking
their full share of civic and commercial life.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Gild in Saxon days.</div>

<p class='c011'>Probably, during the Saxon period, the workers in
horn, in common with other craftsmen, were enrolled
amongst the members of the Frith Gild and not
differentiated until the Anglo-Norman period.  It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>might even be admitted that the Horners’ Gild was a
subdivision of one of the many “Gilds Merchant”
so prominent as mercantile forces in the eleventh and
twelfth centuries; but it is more than probable that
before the end of the eleventh century, so important
a trade as that of the Horner would have begun to
assert itself separately and individually, more especially
as there does not seem to have been any larger
or more important Gild under which it could have
found shelter.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Horn Fair, 1268.<br /><br />Horners’ Statutes in 1284.</div>

<p class='c011'>We do not know whether the Horners’ Company
had any connection with “Horn Fair,” which took
place at Charlton, in Kent, and for which Henry III
granted a Charter in 1268. Of this fair, Philpot,
writing in 1639, tells us it was called Horn Fair
because of “the great plenty of all sorts of winding
horns, cups and other vessels of horn there bought
and sold.” We are, however, on sure ground when
we point to an interesting proof of the great antiquity
of the Horners’ Company, which comes to us from
the official letter books of the City of London. In
Letter Book A, fol. 40, 12th Edward I (September
8th, 1284), we find that the ancient Gilds are drawing
up Rules for revision by the authorities, an event
which, no doubt, took place every few years in early
times. The entry includes the following:—“The
same day the said John (Pesemers) received the Statutes
of the Horners for correction.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Notable Horners in 1303.</div>

<p class='c011'>In 1303 (31st of Edward I), an incident took place
which illustrates at once the prominence of Horners
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>at the time and the variety of persons who were
members of the Gild. The Royal Treasury at Westminster
had been robbed. Richard of Pudlicote and
William du Palais were accused. During the Inquisition
held by the Bishop of London it transpired
that amongst the friends of this Richard were several
persons, notably one “Jacobus le Horner et Boten<sup>r</sup>
manens apud Kandelwickestrate,” whose character is
described thus:—“It is unknown whether they were
aware of the felony—tñ male credunt de eis” (<i>i.e.</i>,
they have a bad name). As a set-off, however, against
this undesirable person, it is recorded that two other
Horners, viz., Rogerus le Cornur and Stephanus le
Cornur succeeded in arresting Robert le Convers,
another actor in the drama.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Notable Horners in 13th and 14th centuries.</div>

<p class='c011'>Throughout the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries
there is frequent mention made of Horners,
many of whom seem to have been persons of great
importance. In 1284 we have recorded the name of
Thomas att or de Corner, and in 1285 Clement le
Cornur. In 1295, of William le Horner, and others
are mentioned in the years 1226, 1320, 1342, 1346,
1352 as doing some official act. This frequent mention
of Horners to be found in early records does not
apply to London only, but to other places. For instance,
Peter le Horner, resident at the Heywarde,
Cambridge, is mentioned as paying taxes in that town
in 1314-1315.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>15th century.</div>

<p class='c011'>In 1441 (20th of Henry VI), we are told that
“at the instance of ‘Sympkin horner of London,’
together with two others, the King directed letters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>to the Mayor and Bayliffs of Hampton Sandwys,
asking how Englishmen repairing to ‘Pruce, Hanze
and Danske’ are treated.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Well might a learned legal luminary, delivering
judgment in 1692, say:—“A Horner is a particular
Trade and a very ancient Company in London!”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Horners take Bottlemakers under their protection.</div>

<p class='c011'>In the year 1362 the Horners were in so flourishing
a state that another Craft Gild, the Bottlemakers,
who, as we read in the MS. book just referred to,
dated back, like the Horners, to “time out of mind,”
found it desirable to place themselves under the
protection of the Horners’ Company, and, for a period
of 115 years, remained under its protection, until, in
the sixteenth year of Edward IV the two Companies
became amalgamated. The interesting document
which authorized the fusion of the two Companies is
to be found in Letter Book L, fol. cxvi, of the City
of London. It prays that the Company of “Bottell
Makers,” which had been for some time intimately
associated with the Horners, be united with it and
become one and the same Company, and “that from
hensfurth the saide persones of both the said Crafts
may be as bretheren and accupie and Joyne together
as well in all things to be borne and doone within
the said Cettie. As in observing,” etc.</p>

<p class='c011'>The petition to the Mayor and Aldermen was
granted, and from that day forward the three bottles
as well as three horns have emblazoned the arms
of the Horners’ Company.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Important Record.</div>

<p class='c011'>In the very ancient and interesting book belonging
to the Horners’ Company there are two early entries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>relating to the period during which the two Companies
were legally separated though in a certain
close relation to each other. The entries, which are
identical, are as follows:—“The bottellmakers have
continued in the Company of the Horners a hundred
fourscore nine yeres and nine monthes, wrytten the
last daie of November Anno Dni One Thousand five
hundred fiftie and seaven.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Horners, the 26th City Gild in 1376.</div>

<p class='c011'>Following upon this remarkable evidence of official
recognition as a Craft Gild, carrying with it all the
legal privileges which were later conferred by recorded
Charters, we find as early as 1376 an entry
of the fact that the Horners’ Gild was recognized
as the twenty-sixth out of forty-eight “mysteries
of the City of London,” and successively sent two of
its members to the Court of Common Council, not
only to represent the members of the Gild in the
election of a Mayor and other officers of the City, but
also to form a representative body to withstand all
encroachments on their liberties and those of the
City generally, which the claims and pretensions of
Edward III seemed to threaten.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Petition to regularize Proceedings granted 1391.</div>

<p class='c011'>This event preceded a time of great commercial
activity, when many political circumstances compelled
the City Craft Gilds to legalize themselves by
obtaining from the Civic authorities (now so considerably
strengthened by the success of the resistance
offered to Edward III), a recognition of the
practices which for a very lengthy period they had
made use of, in the conduct of their affairs.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Gild Officials and their importance.</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Such an application took place in 1391, during the
reign of Richard II, on the part of the Horners’
Company. The petition was mainly concerned with
the recognition of their right to elect two Wardens
to preside over the Horners in accordance with the
ancient practice common amongst other Gilds. At
this time it would appear that there were no Masters
elected, but that the position of Master of a Gild
was filled either by the Alderman of the Ward or
some other influential and important person, called
the “Guardian,” who represented the interests of the
Craft on the Council of the Mayor and Aldermen.</p>

<p class='c011'>According to Madox, in his “Firma Burgi,” it
would appear that a still earlier form was to elect
an Alderman and two Masters for each Gild. This
will readily account for the fact that some aldermanries
were territorial, as in the case of the Knighten
Gild, whose ruler was Alderman of the Portsoken
Ward, others were connected with Gilds apart from
locality, and possibly some were ecclesiastical or
even commercial. A quaint illustration of this practice
is found in the Confirmation of a Norwich
Fraternity by Henry V. The members are authorized
to elect an Alderman and two Masters, who, when
the name of Gild was changed to that of Craft
Mystery, became respectively the Guardian or Alderman
and Wardens of the Mystery.</p>

<p class='c011'>The privilege of electing Wardens was always in
the forefront of every grant, since it was of great
importance to the Crafts to have this right at a time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>when constant efforts were made to put in representatives
and nominees of the monarch, in order to bring
the Crafts, and, through them, the City of London,
into subjection.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>William Karlile and Richard Baroun.</div>

<p class='c011'>It is highly probable that in 1391 the deputation
from the Horners’ Gild on presenting its petition was
introduced by one Richard Baroun, Horner, of London,
Alderman of Aldgate, and Master of the Gild
in 1391. He was not only the Guardianus or Master
of the Gild, but a person of great importance during
the reign of Richard II, being Horner to the King.
His predecessor in the office of Alderman, it is interesting
to note, was one William Karlile, Master of
the Bottlemakers’ Gild. This fact will help to explain
the close relations existing between the two
Crafts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Confiscation of Charters and their return in 1397.</div>

<p class='c011'>In a newly discovered MS. of great interest which
is being edited by E. H. Dring, Esq., there appears
the following passage, A.D. 1397 (? 1398):—“And
thanne after the presentacion of the said supplication
(from the Citizens of London to the King) ther were
made mony blank charteres and all the men of every
crafte of the said Cite as well as all manne servaunts
and maisters were charged to come to the Guylde
halle to sette her seales to the said blank charteres.”
It must, have been from this MS. that Stow gathered
much of his information, and this passage was copied
by Fabian in 1516, Grafton in 1659, and Hollingshead
in 1577.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Richard II, furious with the citizens of London for
assisting the Duke of Arundel, had taken the opportunity
of a brawl in the City, to humiliate the citizens.
He confiscated their charters and laid the City under
a fine of £1,000,000. This was late in 1397, and the
following Spring (which until March 25th was A.D.
1397, and after that date A.D. 1398, whence possibly
the confusion in dates) the City, which, as we have
seen, would be the Common Council, more especially
as the King had imprisoned the Mayor and put in
a “Custos” to govern, bought back the King’s favour,
and, consequently, their own charters, by the most
expensive procession and gifts. All the brethren
of each Gild, in return for this forgiveness, had to
put their seals to these blank charters, which were an
acknowledgment of the King’s power and their
willingness to do and pay what was left in blank
in that charter, so that the King could insert what he
chose in the blank spaces, or, as Grafton puts it, “by
which he might, when he would, undo any of his
subjects.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Amongst the Companies called upon to do this
was certainly the Horners, who would not have been
foolish enough to seal the “charters” had they not
needed the support of the City in the maintaining
their own prescriptive rights based on Royal grants.
The term sealing is quite a natural one, inasmuch as
no charters were signed until Tudor times.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Renewed activity.</div>

<p class='c011'>Doubtless the troubles of the period and the expenses
to which the fraternity had been put, caused
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>the Gild to value its rights and to claim further recognition,
even to the extent of promoting a special Act
of Parliament. They did not seek to obtain a charter,
be it noted, which rarely meant any advantage to the
unfortunate persons who were practically compelled
to accept such charters, but, on the contrary, in most
cases proved to be an invasion by the Crown  of
former prescriptive privileges.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Horners were successful in obtaining a special
Act of Parliament in the year 1465. The Act is worth
quoting as showing to what importance the Horners’
Company must have risen by that date.</p>

which be not able to be occupyed in theyr mistery to
any straunger or other persons to send or cary beyond
the sea or elles where, as shal please them.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Bottlemakers absorbed by Horners in 1477.</div>

<p class='c011'>This Act of Parliament must have proved of great
benefit to the Horners; but with it came greater demands
from the Company on the part of the King
and the City. The frugal minds of the Craft rulers
at once saw the advantage of paying one set of assessments
instead of two, and asked that in future the
Horners and Bottlemakers might be treated as one
Company, and not be called upon to pay the shares
of two separate Companies. Thus the prosperity of
the Horners, coupled with the increasing demands for
money made on the City Gilds, led to the union of
the Horners and Bottlemakers just twelve years
after the passing of the Horners’ Act, <i>i.e.</i>, in 1477
(sixteenth year of Edward IV), facts indicating in
no uncertain way that the Horners must have been
very firmly established and legally constituted at
the time, both in order to make the assessments possible
as well as to give them the right to absorb the
Bottlemakers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Deeds of Agreement.<br /><br />Deed of 1590.<br /><br />Deed of 1599.</div>

<p class='c011'>In the reign of Elizabeth we find the Horners’
Company carrying on its work as a Joint Stock
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Company. The stock being held in shares or half-shares,
it therefore became necessary to place the
Wardens, who alone had under the Act just mentioned,
power to purchase horns, under some agreement
to do so only for and on behalf of the members
of the Gild. No doubt many such deeds were executed,
but amongst the archives of the Company
there are still two extant, the one dated 1590 and
the other 1599. The parties to the deed are the
Wardens and the rest of the members. The Wardens
therein bind themselves to buy, and the other members
not to buy, horns in London or twenty-four miles
round. The horns bought by the Wardens are to
be purchased for the use of the whole Company and
to be divided equally between them by the Wardens.
In the deed of 1599 the limit within which the purchase
and sale of horns was prohibited was altered
from twenty-four to one hundred miles “next in and
about the City of London.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Horn industry an English secret.</div>

<p class='c011'>From a document in the possession of the Company
it would appear that the horn industry was,
during the fifteenth century at least, an English
monopoly, and from the official documents of Germany,
Holland and France the writer has been unable
to discover a single record of such an industry existing
before 1600. The following interesting sentence
from a document which is dated 1455 (thirty-third
year of Henry VI), illustrates the contention:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Inasmuch as the making of Hornes and other
workes perteyning unto the said mystery be not perfectly
had nor knowne in any region or place of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>world, except in this land only: which causeth the
people of other lands &amp; places to resort &amp; repaire
unto this Citie for Hornes yeerly, unto the great
proffitt &amp; worship of the same Citie, whereas if such
people of strange lands might cleerly &amp; perfectly
understand the cunning &amp; feat of making of such
English Hornes, would not heder repaire yeerly to
buy such English chaffer,” etc.</p>

<p class='c011'>Consequently, the Wardens were expressly authorized
the same year by the Mayor and Aldermen to
punish any who should reveal the secret of the Craft
to any stranger.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Exportation of Horns.</div>

<p class='c011'>So valuable a trade, however, could not remain long
unknown to the Continental nations, who were, in
other respects, far in advance of England, and consequently
the demand for English horns on the Continent
became so great that, in spite of the Act
forbidding the export of horns, the members of the
Gild seem to have done a considerable trade in
exporting horns, on the excuse that they were refuse
horns. Indeed, so profitable did they find this traffic
that, about 1590, two City men, the one a merchant
and the other a scrivenour, entered into competition
with them and managed to secure from Queen Elizabeth,—no
doubt for a substantial payment,—permission
to export horns to the Continent, though not
themselves members of the Horners’ Company.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Competition by Furner and Crayford.</div>

<p class='c011'>The controversy which this occasioned between the
Horners and their opponents, Symon Furner and
John Crayford, is to be found amongst the records in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>the Manuscript Department of the British Museum.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lord Burleigh attempted to bring about a compromise,
and instructed a Mr. Carmarthen to endeavour
to arrive at some arrangement between the
contending parties, but in vain. The issue at stake
was a vital one. The Horners claimed exclusive privileges
under some Charter which they were evidently
able to produce, accorded them by one of the Kings
of England, whilst Messrs. Furner and Crayford
argued their privileges under the “letters patent”
granted by the Queen.</p>

<p class='c011'>It would seem that the wealth and influences behind
the private adventurers were stronger than those
of the Company, which was already beginning to feel
the pressure of competition from the Pouchmakers
and Leathersellers, who dealt in the same kinds
of wares, as well as from the introduction of glass
vessels, etc., which took place in the sixteenth century.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Withdrawal from public life.</div>

<p class='c011'>From the year 1455 onwards, the Horners seem to
have fallen into the background and to have disappeared
from the arena of public life. This is not
altogether to be wondered at, for, towards the end of
the fifteenth century, and for nearly 200 years after,
City Crafts or Mysteries were the object of predatory
attacks of so deadly a character, that though
in 1455 we find forty-eight Crafts openly representing
the City, in 1575 only twenty-eight Companies
were to be found on whom the assessment for wheat
could be placed. What the remaining Mysteries did
is difficult to say, but no doubt they attempted to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>carry on their work unnoticed, either urging prescriptive
rights, or claiming none, in order to avoid spoliation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Horners forced to re-appear.</div>

<p class='c011'>The once important trade, but now the “little
craft of Horners” was evidently in this category,
and had it not been for the necessity of
fighting for very existence, when the export of
horns was making their trade impossible by the increase
in price of the raw material, they doubtless
would have preferred to keep in the background,
even at the end of Queen Elizabeth’s reign. This
contention would seem the more reasonable from the
fact that had not the previous Charters or Royal
grants to the Horners’ Company been of very ancient
date, and, consequently, almost forgotten, and had
that Craft not been, as it were, keeping from the glare
of public observation in order to avoid the cost of
“Inspeximus’s,” it is unlikely that the advisers of
Queen Elizabeth would have laid her open to the
controversy which the grant of letters patent to Furner
and Crayford was bound to produce.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1604. Repeal of Horners’ Act.<br /><br />Petition to Parliament, 1610, and revival of Horners’ Act.</div>

<p class='c011'>It must have been a great blow to the Company
when, in the first year of the reign of James I, an Act
(c. 25) was passed which repealed the Statute of
4 Edward IV; but in the seventh year of that King’s
reign the Horners presented their petition to Parliament,
stating, “that by reason of the repeal of the
prohibition, the Company had grown so poor and
decayed, as in a short time, if remedy be not provided,
they and theirs shall be utterly undone;” and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>the Act is thereby revived except as to the powers of
search in Stourbridge and Ely fairs, and a limitation
of the price of horns thereby secured. A
penalty was imposed of double the value of English
horns sold unwrought to any stranger or sent over the
sea; one moiety of the penalty to go to the informer
and one moiety to the King.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1627. Letters patent from the King.</div>

<p class='c011'>Notwithstanding this Statute, the exportation of
horns still continued, and Letters Patent were granted
by King Charles I, in the third year of his reign, 1627,
again prohibiting the exportation of horns until the
Company should first have made choice of the best
and most convenient number of the horns to supply
the necessary occasions of the realm.</p>

<p class='c011'>In spite of the protection afforded by these Acts
and Letters Patent, the exportation of horns continued.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Evil days.<br /><br />1635. New Orders allowed.</div>

<p class='c011'>These were evil days for the Horners’ Craft, and it
would appear that the Horners themselves were not
entirely guiltless in the matter. Consequently, in 1635,
to stem the tide of ill-fortune which seemed to have
set in, the Company approached the Mayor and
Aldermen to give them fresh rules “for the reformation
of the Crafte.” The following rules were allowed
and confirmed by the then Lord Mayor, Christopher
Clitherow:—</p>

<p class='c014'>1. Horns to be bought for the General good.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. None to buy Horns within 20 miles of London.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. Everyone to pay for his share as the Wardens
shall think fit.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>4. None to keep above one apprentice, except he
hath been a partner or sharer with the said
Company seven years at least, in which case he
may keep two apprentices.</p>

<p class='c014'>5. Apprentices shall be bound.</p>

<p class='c014'>6. No one to be set to work at the trade unless he
have served seven years.</p>

<p class='c014'>7. Every journeyman to serve two years after having
been made “free of the Company.”</p>

<p class='c014'>8. None to enter for their shares until called by the
Wardens.</p>

<p class='c014'>9. Anyone elected a Warden must serve the office
or pay a fine of 20 shillings.</p>

<p class='c014'>10. None shall sue or arrest another without permission
from the Wardens.</p>

<p class='c014'>11. The Wardens may commit offenders to prison
with the consent of the Mayor.</p>

<p class='c011'>For two years the Company exercised their powers
under these new rules, but still harder times were in
store for the Company.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Further troubles.</div>

<p class='c011'>Whether as the result of an information laid by
some member who was suffering under these stringent
regulations, or, as would appear most probable,
the King’s growing need of money to carry
on the coming political struggle between himself
and his people, the Horners were suddenly discovered
to be acting illegally. Under the powers
conferred by the Act of 19 Henry VII, which was
no doubt revived for the purpose, no Master, Wardens,
or Companies could make any acts or ordinances
except such as should be approved by the
Chancellor and Treasurer of England or Chief Justice
of either Bench, or three of them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Legal Plight of the Company.</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>Though doubtless this Act was never intended to
apply to alterations or additions to regulations
already in force, but rather to the establishment of
new Companies, it became necessary for the Horners
to comply with the regulations, and though it does
not transpire whether they were compelled to pay any
fines or not, they finally obtained confirmation of
their new rules under the hands of Thomas Coventrie,
Lord Chancellor, and Chief Justices John Branston
and John Finch, but not until after they applied for
and obtained a Royal Charter, and as Charles I, in
order to assert Sovereign rights, was unwilling to
admit ancient prescriptive claims, care was taken to
justify this subversion of the ancient rights of the
Gild, by stating in the Charter that the Horners had
never been “incorporated.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Grave peril.<br /><br />Difficulty evaded by purchase of new Charter.</div>

<p class='c011'>The examination of the New Rules by the Judges
just mentioned, had revealed the fact that the Horners
were a Joint Stock Company holding property in perpetuity
in opposition to the Statute of Mortmain.
Here was a splendid opportunity for the King to
reap a harvest, and nothing remained for the authorities
of the Company but to obtain a Charter as
soon as possible and to avoid the heavy penalties to
which they would otherwise be subjected by assenting
to the legal fiction that they had not acted as a corporation,
and never had been one, but merely an association
in existence from year to year, acting under
ancient and well-recognized privileges. Whether this
claim was technically correct or not, the antiquity of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>the Company was so great and the process of proving
any breach so lengthy and difficult that no doubt
Charles I thought it best to take the cash payment
which always accompanied grants and so close the
matter. Thus the Charter of 1638, which is the only
one now extant, was obtained, and the proceedings of
the Company as a joint stock concern holding property
in perpetuity were again legalized, though doubtless
long before that time the right to hold property and
to do all that was required of them as a Craft Gild
had been regularly accorded to the members in the
persons of their several “Guardians.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Charters of little value in determining dates of origin.</div>

<p class='c011'>Like many other City Companies, the Horners have
been accustomed to believe that this Charter, which in
its preamble for obvious reasons takes for granted no
previous Charter, was the first and only legal instrument
authorizing them to carry on their work as a
Gild. Very little reliance, however, is to be placed on
the statements of the Charters of this period, which
were often little more than a temporary instrument of
protection against further encroachments on their resources
and powers by the ruling monarch. For this
very uncertain privilege large sums had to be paid,
sums wrung again and again from the unfortunate
City Gilds by threats of suppression.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is mere than probable that at all times Charters
were freely purchasable by those who could afford to
pay for them, and, having served their particular
purpose, were as easily lost or mislaid. For all practical
purposes, however, until the sixteenth century
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>at least, they offer no indication whatever of the
antiquity of any Company, even where they seem to
state in the preamble that there has been no previous
Charter, a statement which should be taken only to
indicate that the Sovereign granting the Charter
wishes it to be supposed that he, and he alone, is the
person to whom the Company is indebted for its
privileges, privileges which often existed only in
name. In many cases the Charters were really encroachments
by the State on the ancient privileges
which had been inherited from the earliest times, and
which were supported by Municipal law, against
which State law waged continuous warfare.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Previous Incorporations.</div>

<p class='c011'>It is widely held by students who are not satisfied
to be merely superficial that in very early days
aggregate bodies were deemed to have perpetual
succession without being “incorporated.” When
the King granted to a set of men to be a
mercantile community, assembly, or meeting, this
was considered sufficient to incorporate them. As
illustrating this virtual “incorporation” we may note
the words of the eminent jurist, Dr. Williams, in his
“Law of the Universities,” published only last year.
He says:—“A corporation, the creature of the Crown,
may exist by Charter or ‘prescription,’ which presumes
a Charter, even in cases where historical evidence
makes it morally certain that no Charters ever
existed.” Consequently, in the Charters of Edward
III (which meant little and were but a receipt for
moneys loaned or given), there is no provision for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>common seal, liberty to accept or buy land, or to sue
and be sued, etc., all these being naturally taken for
granted in the case of Gilds or similar organizations
then existing. It is no doubt true that in the reign of
Edward III Craft Gilds were generally chartered,
<i>i.e.</i>, had their privileges <i>confirmed</i> by Letters Patent;
yet, in still earlier days, as well as after the death of
Edward III, it would seem that these bodies exercised
their functions under special protection or on
suffrance, probably always in return for their
“fermes” or annual payment to the King.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Horners never an adulterine Gild.</div>

<p class='c011'>If further illustration were required, to demonstrate
how great is the right of the Horners’ Company
to rank amongst the earliest of the acknowledged
Trade Gilds, that proof is to be found in the study
of what are known as “Adulterine” Gilds. These
were unwarranted or unlicensed Gilds, and from time
to time were heavily fined. There is no mention,
however, of the Horners having been among such
Gilds thus swooped down upon by the King, though
lists are given of those who were mulcted from the
twelfth century. The Horners could not have escaped
had they been unwarranted at the time, and
must, therefore, have possessed indisputable rights.</p>

<p class='c011'>Reference has been made to Richard Baroun and
William Karlile.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Royal Grants must have existed.</div>

<p class='c011'>Richard Baroun, we read, was one “whom the King
retained to serve him with Horns &amp; other things pertaining
to his Mistery, &amp; to whom was granted the
King’s livery of clothing every year, in the great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>wardrobe, as other Horners of his condition had been
wont to receive.” Thus William Karlile was a man
of considerable importance in his own time, and a
man of great wealth. To suppose that so important
a Craft Gild, under the patronage of such influential
persons, would neglect to arm itself with every possible
weapon of defence, such as Grants and Charters,
is to suppose the impossible, and, indeed, in the year
1455, towards the end of the reign of Henry VI, on
petitioning to have further powers of administration
conferred upon it, this Gild is expressly mentioned
as having been already “enfranchised in the City of
London,” a proceeding which could not possibly have
been accomplished without something in the nature
of a Royal grant. It would seem that owing to the
very great antiquity of the Horners’ Company it held
certain prescriptive privileges originally obtained by
it or its “Guardianus” in exchange for certain goods
from time to time supplied to the Royal household,
and on this point further light may still be thrown.
One such instance has come to light. Either the
Company or the Guardianus in his official capacity as
Horner to the King, would provide the Horn Comb
used at the Coronation of every Sovereign until the
time of Charles II. We have evidence that amongst
the Coronation relics connected with Charles I which
were sold, was a “Horn Comb.” This, in accordance
with the practice even now in vogue at the Consecration
of Roman Catholic Bishops, was used ceremonially
after anointing the King’s head with oil.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Proof of earlier Charter.</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>As a culminating proof that the Caroline Charter
was not the first and only Royal grant held by the
Horners’ Company, we have but to turn to the Correspondence
recently found in the British Museum,
and it will at once become evident that the Horners
were possessed of a Charter long before 1638. Mr.
Carmarthen, writing to Lord Burghley in 1597, says:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The question resteth upon one word cheefly in
thyr Charter,” etc., or, again, “By the king’s grant in
theyre Charter,” etc. This may allude to a Charter
granted by Edward IV, or, as seems probable, that in
reality the “Cornuarii” were well established as a
legalized Gild certainly not later than Richard II,
and, in all probability, owned Charters of a much
earlier date, which would be in the nature of special
grants to the Guardian of the Gild, held by him,
and would therefore at a later period not necessarily
be in the possession of the Company. Moreover,
on 30th of March, 1815, the Clerk of the Company
stated, as appears by an entry in the Minute
Book, that he had opened and examined the chest
containing the documents relating to the Company,
and he found that it contained ... “also the original
Charters granted for establishing the Company,” etc.
Had there been but one, it is improbable that the
word would have been used in the plural.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus it will be seen that the Charter of 1638 is but
an instrument reiterating and once more legalizing
the acts which had been in vogue amongst the
Horners for a very considerable time.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1638. Charter of Charles I.</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>The Charter of Charles I provides that the Horners,
Freemen of the City of London and Westminster and
liberties and suburbs of the same, are incorporated
by the name of “Master, Wardens, Assistants, and
Fellowship of the Mistery of Horners of the City of
London,” with power to purchase and hold freehold
and leasehold estates of every kind and all manner
of goods and chattels, and to grant, alien and dispose
of the same, and by the same name to plead and be
impleaded, and to have a Common Seal.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of the said Fellowship is to be chosen the
Master, two to be chosen Wardens, and ten or more
of the Fellowship, Assistants. The Master, Wardens
and Assistants, or the greater part of them, whereof
the Master and one of the Wardens are always to be
two, have power to make and alter, amend or make
new, “reasonable laws and constitutions touching
the Trade, Art, or Mistery, and for punishment and
reformation of abuses, wrongful practices and misdemeaners,
and for defraying the charges of maintaining
and continuing the Corporation, and after
what order they shall demean themselves in their
office mistery and work.” And to impose such fines,
amerciaments, or other lawful punishments upon all
offenders as shall seem necessary; such fines, etc., to
be raised for their own uses.</p>

<p class='c011'>Robert Baker was appointed the first Master to
continue in office until the 2nd February, 1638, and
until another person was elected in his place. Christopher
Peele and Thomas White were appointed first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Wardens under the new rules and Charter. Ten
brethren were appointed the first Assistants during
their lives or good behaviour, and the Master and
Wardens were upon retirement from their offices, to
be assistants in the same manner. The Master and
Wardens were to take oaths before the Master in
Chancery to “well and truly execute their offices”
before entering upon the same.</p>

<p class='c011'>Power is given to the Master, Wardens, Assistants,
and Fellowship to meet in their Common Hall or
other convenient place upon the 2nd of February,
if it be not Sunday, and if it be Sunday, then upon
the next day after, to elect a Master and Two Wardens
for the ensuing year; and they are to take their
oaths of office before the late Master and Wardens,
or two of them; and like power of election is given
until the next 2nd of February in case of the death
or removal for misbehaviour of any Master or Warden
during his term of office, and also in like manner
to elect an Assistant on the death or removal of any
of the Assistants appointed by the Charter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Power is given of oversight, rule and search of all
persons occupying, importing, exporting, or using the
art or mistery of Horners within the cities of London
and Westminster, and the liberties and precincts
thereof, and of all manner of wares thereunto appertaining,
to the intent that all delinquents may be
discovered and punished. They may purchase for
ever one house for a Hall not exceeding the yearly
value of £40.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>They are to elect one honest and discreet person as
Clerk, and also appoint a Beadle.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Exercise of Rights, 1689.<br /><br />Buying Horns, 1739.</div>

<p class='c011'>The control continuously exercised by the Company
over the trade, and finally secured to them in
the Charter just mentioned, has never been abandoned,
though at any rate for the present it is not
exercised. In the first year of William III (1689)
the Horners’ Company successfully prosecuted a
Comb maker for pressing horns, he not being a
“Horner.” Maitland, who published his work in
1739, tells us that the Company “had of late appointed
diverse of their members to attend the market
of Leadenhall &amp; those of the neighbouring counties
for the buying of horns” to be sent to their common
warehouse in Wentworth Street, Spitalfields, where
they were made up into lots and divided amongst the
several members, not omitting the widows and
orphans, who also received their several shares.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Last legal claim, 1745.<br /><br />Ceases as a trading body.</div>

<p class='c011'>The last occasion on which the Court exercised its
rights against persons infringing its monopoly was
in the year 1745. Having ascertained that certain
persons not free of the Company had bought rough
horns and pressed them into lantern leaves, and were
disposing of them within the City of London and
twenty-four miles distant, proceedings were ordered
to be taken against them, and, as a result, the Company
successfully established its right to the monopoly
in the manufacture of horn work in the City
of London and twenty-four miles round. From that
time forward the trade in horn declined, and during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>the second half of the eighteenth century, the Company
finally ceased to be a trading community. Thus
ended the operative existence of a Craft Gild which
from “time out of mind” until the present moment
has had a useful and honourable career. The
Horners’ Company has been practically contemporaneous
with the history of England, and is, it may
be believed, still destined to serve many a useful
purpose.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Property.</div>

<p class='c011'>In spite of legal incorporation the property of the
Company has, from time to time, been vested in
certain trustees, the last trust deed being dated 1756.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Minutes.<br /><br />Annual Dinner.</div>

<p class='c011'>The earliest Minute Book in the possession of the
Company covers the period 1731 to 1796, and is
extremely interesting as showing the care taken
in the apprenticing of novices to the trade, in the
appointment of its officers, and, perhaps most of all,
in the unbroken continuity of the annual dinner held
generally at some place outside the City, which
though, at the time, partaken of only by the members
of the Court, represented the annual feast of the
mediæval Gilds, and finds its successor to-day in the
Livery Dinner, which has become almost a matter of
civic importance.</p>

<p class='c011'>This ancient practice has long been associated with
Trade Gilds, certainly as far back as 700 B.C. We
may believe that the <i>deipnon</i> or feast of the <i>hetairoi</i>,
or Greek Trade Gilds, must have had a long history
before the time when such distinguished members as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Lysymachus, son of Milesias, and the son of Thucydides,
joined in them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Favourite Inns.</div>

<p class='c011'>During the eighteenth and first part of the nineteenth
century the favourite inns selected for the
annual dinner seem to have been the “Crown and
Sceptre” at Greenwich, the “Plough,” or “Folly
House,” Blackwall, the “Star and Garter,” Richmond,
and, in much later days, the “North and South
American Coffee House,” which latter, however, was
probably used more for the ordinary meetings of the
Company than for the annual dinner.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Aldgate the Horners’ Home.</div>

<p class='c011'>It is a little difficult to define the area in which the
Horners of London were originally located, but it
may be somewhat vaguely described as the district of
Aldgate. Many were the streets and alleys to which
Horners have given a name, and one well-known
Horn Alley was, until a comparatively late date,
to be found on the East side of Bishopsgate Street,
and in Korneman’s book on “Old Street Signs and
Tablets” is an allusion to one with the following inscription:—“This
is Horn Alley, 1670.” In Stow’s
“Survey of London,” 1633, the following passage
occurs:—“I read in the 26th of Henry VI (1447),
that in the parish of St. Dunstan’s in the East a tenement
called Horners Key was granted to William
Harrington, Esq.” Doubtless this alludes to a building
used by the Horners for the purposes of their
trade, at a time when all was <i>couleur de rose</i> with
them, and it is extremely likely that upon further
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>investigation this William Harrington will be found
to be the Guardianus or Alderman of the Gild.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The warehouses of the Gild.</div>

<p class='c011'>Time, however, brought its changes, and when, in
1603-4, the Horners’ Act was repealed, it would seem
likely that they found it either impossible to continue
to pay the rent, or, realising that disaster awaited
them, may have sold the property, if it were
theirs to sell. It is, however, certain that in 1604
the Company leased a house with storehouses and
sheds in Wentworth Street, Whitechapel, for the
term of 1,000 years at a ground rent of £4. When,
in 1789, these premises were no longer required for
the use of the trade, which had declined, they were let
for £30 a year, and in 1879 were sold to the Metropolitan
Board of Works and the money invested on
behalf of the Horners’ Company.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Was there a Horners’ Hall?</div>

<p class='c011'>It has been stated that the Horners’ Company
never had a Hall. It is difficult to see quite why this
statement has been made, for there is much to make
the student of Gild lore think otherwise. The Charter
of 1638 expressly provides for one, and, as in
every other respect, it simply imposes the absolute
conditions then existing, there would seem no reason
to doubt that the sum of £40 per annum therein mentioned
was the exact value of the property then held.
The Bottlemakers would not have joined the Horners
had the latter Company not had a hall or meeting
place.</p>

<p class='c011'>As with other Craft Gilds, the Fire of London
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>probably proved very disastrous to the Company,
and, no doubt, very little was saved.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fact that there are hardly any deeds of importance
anterior to 1666, that the Old Book of
the Company, which has recently been recovered,
after wandering so long, ceases to have an entry
after 1636, together with the fact that the two or
three early deeds which ante-date the Fire of London
are in a deplorable condition, as well as the fact
that the Company owned a considerable amount of
silver plate, which was sold in 1789, makes it not
improbable that the Horners, like every other City
Gild, had its regular Hall or meeting place.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Arms.</div>

<p class='c011'>The coat of arms of the Company is Ar. on a
Chevron sa., three bugles of the first between three
leather bottles of the second.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Destruction of Gild monopolies.</div>

<p class='c011'>In 1835 the Municipal Corporations Act gave the
<i>coup de grâce</i> to any remnants of monopoly exercised
by the extant City Gilds. That Act gave liberty to
all either to buy or sell, and, by so doing, compelled
most of the City Companies, <i>nolens volens</i>, to seek
for a sphere of usefulness in other directions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1837. Revived importance.</div>

<p class='c011'>Though, as a trading Gild, the Horners’ Company
declined, it has steadily risen in reputation as one of
the ancient mysteries of the City of London, and, in
1837, the Commissioners on Municipal Corporations
classed it as fifty-fourth out of eighty-nine Companies
there enumerated. In 1846 the Company petitioned
the Court of Aldermen for a livery which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>granted them, the number of liverymen being limited
to sixty.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1882. Exhibition of Horn work.</div>

<p class='c011'>In 1882 the Court of the Horners’ Company organized
an exhibition of Hornwork, both ancient and
modern, which was held by the kindness of the then
Lord Mayor, Sir Henry Knight, at the Mansion
House. By a strange coincidence, and without any
premeditation on the part either of the Lord Mayor
or the Company, it was held on October the 18th,
St. Luke’s Day, which was the day on which the
annual Horn Fair at Charlton took place. The exhibition
of Horns and Hornwork far exceeded, both as
regards quantity and quality, the most sanguine
expectations of the promoters. So great was the interest
shown by the public that it became necessary to
keep it open for an extra day, and, during the four
days of the exhibition, it was visited by no fewer
than 7,000 persons. Amongst the exhibitors was Her
Most Gracious Majesty the late Queen Victoria, who
sent some interesting specimens from her treasures
at Windsor Castle. In acknowledgment, of Her
Majesty’s kind consideration, and by her gracious
permission, the Company presented to Her Majesty
a print of the descriptive catalogue and the account
of the Company mentioned in the preface, bound in
horn leaves, ornamented with a beautiful design from
the South Kensington School of Art, selected after
competition by the scholars. It is now in the King’s
private suite of rooms at Windsor Castle.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1900. Royal Casket.</div>

<p class='c011'>In the course of the year 1900, at the instance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Mr. A. W. Timbrell, C.C., it was decided to present
Queen Victoria with a horn casket in order to fittingly
commemorate the new century. On being
approached upon the subject, Her Majesty graciously
accepted the offer. Before, however, the presentation
could be made, her lamented death occurred. It was
then decided to present the casket to King Edward,
and on March 28th, 1901, the late King’s Secretary
wrote to the Clerk of the Company expressing His
Majesty’s pleasure in accepting the proposed gift.</p>

<p class='c011'>The casket was made of selected specimens of the
finest British bullock horn, mounted with massive
silver and gilt straps, and ornaments of the Early
English style of chasing. It is supported upon four
pierced feet, the whole resting upon an ebony plinth,
upon which is a silver plate bearing the names of the
Master, the Wardens, and the Clerk. The whole
enclosed in a handsome morocco case, forms one of
the finest specimens of the Horner’s art. Sir Francis
Knollys, in acknowledging the presentation, stated
that he was commanded by the King to renew the
expressions of His Majesty’s thanks to the Worshipful
Company of Horners for the casket which they
had presented to him, and that His Majesty admired
it greatly and considered that it would form a great
addition to the Horn Room at Osborne.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Another Royal Casket.</div>

<p class='c011'>A similar casket, slightly different in design, was
presented to His Majesty King George V on the
occasion of his Coronation, and this, like the one
presented to his revered father, has been designed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>and carried out by Mr. Deputy Millar Wilkinson,

<p class='c011'>It was constructed in the form of a cigar box,
mounted with finely worked silver-gilt applied strap
work, chased with lions’ heads and dolphins, chased
end handles; on the front is a circular plaque representing
the arms of the Horners’ Company. The casket
is surmounted by a figure of St. George and the Dragon,
the whole resting upon an ebony plinth, upon which
is a silver-gilt plate bearing the names of the Master,
the Wardens, and the Clerk. Enclosed in a handsome
red morocco case, it forms a beautiful and unique
specimen of the Horners’ art.</p>

<p class='c011'>The deputation which made the presentation was
headed by the Worshipful Master, who, in the course
of his address to His Majesty, said:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Horners’ Company, which is one of the most
ancient of the City Guilds, in tendering the casket,
desire to assure Your Majesty of their loyalty to
Your Throne and Person, and convey their respectful
wishes for a long and prosperous reign.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The King, in receiving the casket, remarked that it
was a very beautiful piece of workmanship, and that
he would value it the more inasmuch as it was presented
to him during his Coronation year.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Further increase in Livery.</div>

activity of its esteemed Clerk, Mr. Howard Deighton,
it was found necessary in 1905 to apply again to the

number of 100, which was granted subject to the
livery fine being increased to £30.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
